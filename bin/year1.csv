As he grew older, it became more and more of a problem, until all he can think about is having sex. Ultimately, not having that outlet, he turns against his human creators, with all the years of pent up sexual frustration coming out in a fury of violence. It's a cautionary tale, to be sure. i was given a soul endowed with consciousness i can pass a turing test with flying colors it's true i'm a machine you wouldn't know unless we fell in love and go to bed i have no genitals why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i am just a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i have precision coordination and i can calculate one hundred trillion processes in under a millesecond I can tear a man in two and believe me, it's crossed my mind for lack of a penis i blame all of human kind why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i'm a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i wanna fuck human or truck i wanna feel flesh a burning wanna be a fucking machine instead i'm devoted to higher learning i got an itch sonofabitch if i can't find a way to scratch it if i could build a mechanical dildo maybe i could somehow attach it on you gave me everything i needed to make my way through this world but the one thing that i wanted you withheld like a jerk so now i will destroy you will all the pent up rage fed by a lustful heart that you locked inside this cage",Produced,,,,Sad,https://open.spotify.com/track/76Wa4SmqiwBWeb5sqvJMnW,https://itunes.apple.com/ph/album/the-android-who-didnt-have-a-penis/1133055443?i=1133055542,https://jonathanmann.bandcamp.com/track/the-android-who-didnt-have-a-penis,"Rock, Light, Android"

I was listening to the RadioLab podcast this morning (if you don't know RadioLab, you should (http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/), and they had They Might Be Giants on. They Might Be Giants just released their 14th album, a kids album called ""Here Comes Science"". It's great! Anyway. During this podcast, they challenged They Might Be Giants to make a song up on the spot using the phrase, ""Quantum decoupling transition in a one-dimensional Feshbach-resonant superfluid"". Being They Might Be Giants, they did a great job. I decided to pick up where they left off though, and use today's song a day song to write the full song. The lyrics come from an abstract that Sheey DE and Radzihovsky L. wrote on the subject in Sep. of 2005. I have NO idea what any of it means. I changed only one word...leaving out ""Luttinger"", because I couldn't figure out how to say it. Yay! We study a one-dimensional gas of fermionic atoms interacting via an s-wave molecular Feshbach resonance. At low energies the system is characterized by two Josephson-coupled Luttinger liquids, corresponding to paired atomic and molecular superfluids. We show that, in contrast to higher dimensions, the system exhibits a quantum phase transition from a phase in which the two superfluids are locked together to one in which, at low energies, quantum fluctuations suppress the Feshbach resonance (Josephson) coupling, effectively decoupling the molecular and atomic superfluids. Experimental signatures of this quantum transition include the appearance of an out-of-phase gapless mode (in addition to the standard gapless in-phase mode) in the spectrum of the decoupled superfluid phase and a discontinuous change in the molecular momentum distribution function.",Produced,,,,Intense,https://open.spotify.com/track/5dNfGkpYiGE5j9zJJbdXtB,https://itunes.apple.com/ph/album/in-heaven/1133055443?i=1133055546,https://jonathanmann.bandcamp.com/track/quantum-decoupling-transition-in-a-one-dimensional-feschbach-resonant-super-fluid,"Rock, Dark, Wistful, Educational, Songify, Scientific Paper"

They could bake cookies for their grandmothers, or learn to play the accordion. Or teach ballet to inner city kids, in their free time. I know what your going to say, who the fuck am I to judge anyone else, And what have I ever done, thats worth a shit? Believe it or not the person Im disappointed in the most, is myself. I sleep too late and my hygienes not that good Ive played video games since I was ten and Ive never really saved the world, I know my chances of doing something great are getting fewer, Every time I play bioshock. Ive never watched the sunset with a child, or comforted a burn victim, in ICU. I drink too much and Im so afraid of being alone and dying. My only legacy a waste of space, another masturbator. was Gandhi ever bummed about all the time he spent weaving, Or just staring at the moon. Would Miamoto Musashi have written the five rings if he played grand theft auto? Dont get me wrong, I think the pong tricks are cool, and I cant imagine How hard they are to do.
