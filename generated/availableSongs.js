ever attempt at auto-tuning. I'm a huge fan of the Auto-Tune the News guys (and gal) the Gregory Brothers. They are so amazingly talented. I've often thought about trying it myself and using it as a song-a-day video.\r\n\r\nI know that there were probably going to be dozens  (if not more) auto-tune versions of this video, and I wanted to see if I could be the first. So it was created in 3 hours. Even if it's not the best (which I'm sure it won't be!), at least it'll be the first! Which maybe counts for something? Maybe the song should have been longer! Oh well. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in some ways this is actually a really difficult video to auto-tune. There's a TON of background noise, and there are multiple \"singers\" all speaking over each other. I wonder how other folks are going to handle this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a remix, it's actually really simple. There's only 4 chords the whole time: Am-G-F-E    a classic chord progression. The main guy just happened to be speaking mostly in Am. I made it slow because I thought that kind of fit the mood of the tornado somehow. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you're the dudes in the video, please contact me!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\nHoly shit!\r\n(Tornado mother fucker!)\r\n\r\nOh my god I'm gonna get nailed!\r\nOh my god, oh my god\r\n\r\nDude, dude, dude, dude here it comes!\r\n(what the fuck?!)\r\n\r\nHoly fuck!

She died on September 23rd 2010. She allegedly hired two gunmen, trading sex for their services, to come into her home and kill her husband and step-son. She also allegedly offered up sex with her 16 year old daughter as collateral for the job.The point of this song is that no human, or group of humans, should be able to take another human's life. They just shouldn't. If she indeed did what they say she did, life in prison would have been an adequate sentence. Killing her solves absolutely nothing. Her daughter, the family member left to grieve, will never have a chance to fully forgive her mother.

It was actually more like a fort - with metal bars you climbed up to get to the 2nd story - which had a railing all around. Then - you could exit from the top by sliding down a fireman's pole, or... climbing down a long, knotted rope.\n\nOn the other side of the structure were two hella long swings! The whole thing was built on the side of a hill, so you could swing waaaaaay out over the hill and jump off the swing, HIGH in the air and fall into leaves at the bottom of the hill. But it was very simple, architectural. Image attached.\n\nAbout two years later, the next-door neighbors built a super fancy hi-tech treehouse even higher up, in a real tree, next door. It had carpet, electricity - really swanky. BUT they were very stingy about sharing it, and it always felt a bit too high up, too scary. \n\nI still think ours was better. It was more like a sculpture you could play on, and it was open to everyone. It had symmetry, and class. It was a real testament to how much our dad loved us and wanted us to have fun - and also, his engineering mind. Maximum fun, minimum materials.. and still as strong the day we moved out as the day he built it.  \"","topic":"Friend","mood":"Pensive","beard":"Clean","location":"BerkeleyStudio","instrument":"AcousticGuitar","background":"#f5cffc","tags":["FOLK","WISTFUL","FORT"],"releasedAt":"2010-11-08"},{"id":"679","number":679,"year":"2","youtubeId":"Ds8WKLO7g8Y","title":"This Song and Video Are Essentially About Not Having Enough Time","description":"This song is essentially about not having enough time. ;","topic":"Life","mood":"Tired","beard":"Clean","location":"BerkeleyStudio","instrument":"ElectricGuitar","background":"#f3cffc","tags":["ROCK","DREAMY","LIGHT"],"releasedAt":"2010-11-10"},{"id":"682","number":682,"year":"2","youtubeId":"JXV99SglXxQ","title":"People Only Love You If You've Got White Teeth","description":"Yaya!","topic":"Poetic","mood":"Silly","beard":"Clean","location":"BerkeleyStudio","instrument":"ElectricGuitar","background":"#f1cffc","tags":["ROCK","VOCODER"],"releasedAt":"2010-11-13"},{"id":"683","number":683,"year":"2","youtubeId":"M2XFEGaCn0Q","title":"Nowhere I Ought to Be (redux)","description":"Here's the original video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afs_i0dAg1A\n\nI've recently subscribed to Charlyne Yi's youtube channel.
