      "NOTE: I'm in a video contest, please vote for me! http://ow.ly/1qlPp\r\n\r\nI was super inspired when I saw Merton's now-famous Chatroulette Improv Piano video last week. I had a kind of \"why didn't I think of that!\" moment, and immediately wondered what I could do to sort of build on his idea. And after seeing his interview on Mashable, I knew I had to make a tribute to him. He's really an awesome guy. A lot of what he said there resonated with me, especially the bit about knowing from the start that he didn't want to be mean. \"Mean\" (or sarcastic, ironic, sardonic, etc) is the default position of so many people on the internet; it's nice to see someone who not only thinks that should change, but seems to be embodying that change himself. That's what I aspire to in general, and with Song A Day specifically. \r\n\r\nImprovisation is not really my strong suit. I'm not terrible at it, but I'm a songwriter first and that's how I tend to frame the music I make. After about 2 straight hours of improvisation (which was an exhilarating experience, really, and I'm bound to do it a bunch more), I met Zach and Cloe. After getting to know them a bit, I was able to hit on a structure around which I could build a song. I then took that raw audio file, brought it into Record (the music making program I use) and did what I do daily: produced the song out a bit. \r\n\r\nI really hope you enjoy it. Especially Merton! If he sees it.\r\n\r\nWhat I got in the end is Song A Day #449: Zach and Cloe, Improv Tribute to Merton",

Despite knowing ahead of time that people would miss the sarcasm, the satire, I was still surprised by the amount of people.\r\n\r\nI wanted to write a follow-up song. It's not so much the here-and-now of Terry Jones' publicity stunt, and it never was. It's about the hatred and intolerance that is bubbling back up to the stoplight after, what, 20 or so years of being just beneath the surface. We are not post-racial, we are not post-religion. These people are serious, and the trouble that they're stirring up is bound to have dire consequences somewhere down the line. That was the point of the last song, perhaps a little too subtly, and so here it is, more explicit.",

      "Download this song! http://jonathanmann.bandcamp.com/track/autotune-the-bronado\r\n\r\nOriginal video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCE_qiy-sOQ\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever attempt at auto-tuning. I'm a huge fan of the Auto-Tune the News guys (and gal) the Gregory Brothers. They are so amazingly talented. I've often thought about trying it myself and using it as a song-a-day video.\r\n\r\nI know that there were probably going to be dozens  (if not more) auto-tune versions of this video, and I wanted to see if I could be the first. So it was created in 3 hours. Even if it's not the best (which I'm sure it won't be!), at least it'll be the first! Which maybe counts for something? Maybe the song should have been longer! Oh well. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in some ways this is actually a really difficult video to auto-tune. There's a TON of background noise, and there are multiple \"singers\" all speaking over each other. I wonder how other folks are going to handle this issue.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a remix, it's actually really simple. There's only 4 chords the whole time: Am-G-F-E    a classic chord progression. The main guy just happened to be speaking mostly in Am. I made it slow because I thought that kind of fit the mood of the tornado somehow. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you're the dudes in the video, please contact me!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nLYRICS:\r\nWhat the fuck?\r\nHoly shit!\r\n(Tornado mother fucker!)\r\n\r\nOh my god I'm gonna get nailed!\r\nOh my god, oh my god\r\n\r\nDude, dude, dude, dude here it comes!\r\n(what the fuck?!)\r\n\r\nHoly fuck! Holy shit!\r\nGet inside now go!\r\nhahahaha!\r\n\r\nDude oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!\r\nlook at that! look at the tree! the tree! look at tree! look at the tree!\r\nHoly shit! this is fucking crazy! \r\nlook at that !look at the tree! the tree! look at tree! look at the tree!\r\n\r\nDude, get inside bro...\r\nThe wind, the wind is crazy!\r\nDude, look at it's funneling!\r\nThe wind, the wind is crazy!",

It was awesome and surreal, just as you'd expect from them. A lot of it was just looking at a typical office hallway with random people milling about. Sometimes there were little moments of excitement. ; They had this weird ethereal music playing...I loved that part. I decided I'd write my song a day for them today, and I just randomly started capturing footage. Much to my delight, suddenly something INCREDIBLE happened...",

    description:
      'A request from my friend Robin! \n\nHer email:\n\n"The treehouse was built for me and my brother by my dad. It was actually more like a fort - with metal bars you climbed up to get to the 2nd story - which had a railing all around. Then - you could exit from the top by sliding down a fireman\'s pole, or... climbing down a long, knotted rope.\n\nOn the other side of the structure were two hella long swings! The whole thing was built on the side of a hill, so you could swing waaaaaay out over the hill and jump off the swing, HIGH in the air and fall into leaves at the bottom of the hill. But it was very simple, architectural. Image attached.\n\nAbout two years later, the next-door neighbors built a super fancy hi-tech treehouse even higher up, in a real tree, next door. It had carpet, electricity - really swanky. BUT they were very stingy about sharing it, and it always felt a bit too high up, too scary. \n\nI still think ours was better. It was more like a sculpture you could play on, and it was open to everyone. It had symmetry, and class. It was a real testament to how much our dad loved us and wanted us to have fun - and also, his engineering mind. Maximum fun, minimum materials.. and still as strong the day we moved out as the day he built it.  "',
