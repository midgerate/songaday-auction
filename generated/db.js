Ultimately, not having that outlet, he turns against his human creators, with all the years of pent up sexual frustration coming out in a fury of violence. It's a cautionary tale, to be sure. i was given a soul endowed with consciousness i can pass a turing test with flying colors it's true i'm a machine you wouldn't know unless we fell in love and go to bed i have no genitals why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i am just a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i have precision coordination and i can calculate one hundred trillion processes in under a millesecond I can tear a man in two and believe me, it's crossed my mind for lack of a penis i blame all of human kind why give me libido without the parts to back it up i know just what i crave but i'm a slave to the lust that's running through my pipes i'll rust if i don't do it tonight I feel the burn in every electric node if i don't let it out soon, i will explode i wanna fuck human or truck i wanna feel flesh a burning wanna be a fucking machine instead i'm devoted to higher learning i got an itch sonofabitch if i can't find a way to scratch it if i could build a mechanical dildo maybe i could somehow attach it on you gave me everything i needed to make my way through this world but the one thing that i wanted you withheld like a jerk so now i will destroy you will all the pent up rage fed by a lustful heart that you locked inside this cage","topic":"Sex","mood":"Sad","beard":"Shadow","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Piano","background":"#ffccdd","tags":["Rock","Light","Android"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-18"},{"number":262,"year":"1","youtubeId":"o-OHmBtcH1k","title":"You Can Do It, Sam","description":"A song for my good friend SAm, who is quitting smoking.","topic":"Friend","mood":"Excited","beard":"Clean","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Synths","background":"#ffccde","tags":["Electro","Distortion","Dreamy","Motivational"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-19"},{"number":263,"year":"1","youtubeId":"3PlhMnSlk-w","title":"The Sex Machine That Couldn't Love","description":"i was a sex machine back in the forties i was the first of my kind","topic":"Sex","mood":"Sad","beard":"Clean","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Synths","background":"#ffccdf","tags":["Electro","Vocoder","Dreamy","Dark"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-20"},{"number":264,"year":"1","youtubeId":"XDJTTRhIrSc","title":"The Robot That Lived on the Moon and Wished It Were Human","description":"Title says it all!

I was listening to the RadioLab podcast this morning (if you don't know RadioLab, you should (http://blogs.wnyc.org/radiolab/), and they had They Might Be Giants on. They Might Be Giants just released their 14th album, a kids album called \"Here Comes Science\". It's great! Anyway. During this podcast, they challenged They Might Be Giants to make a song up on the spot using the phrase, \"Quantum decoupling transition in a one-dimensional Feshbach-resonant superfluid\". Being They Might Be Giants, they did a great job. I decided to pick up where they left off though, and use today's song a day song to write the full song. The lyrics come from an abstract that Sheey DE and Radzihovsky L. wrote on the subject in Sep. of 2005. I have NO idea what any of it means. I changed only one word...leaving out \"Luttinger\", because I couldn't figure out how to say it. Yay! We study a one-dimensional gas of fermionic atoms interacting via an s-wave molecular Feshbach resonance. At low energies the system is characterized by two Josephson-coupled Luttinger liquids, corresponding to paired atomic and molecular superfluids. We show that, in contrast to higher dimensions, the system exhibits a quantum phase transition from a phase in which the two superfluids are locked together to one in which, at low energies, quantum fluctuations suppress the Feshbach resonance (Josephson) coupling, effectively decoupling the molecular and atomic superfluids. Experimental signatures of this quantum transition include the appearance of an out-of-phase gapless mode (in addition to the standard gapless in-phase mode) in the spectrum of the decoupled superfluid phase and a discontinuous change in the molecular momentum distribution function.","topic":"Science","mood":"Intense","beard":"Clean","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Synths","background":"#ffcce0","tags":["Rock","Dark","Wistful","Educational","Songify","Scientific Paper"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-22"},{"number":266,"year":"1","youtubeId":"33Z5uAyPF8g","title":"In Heaven","description":"don't turn away from the light in the sky it might be god, he might be wearing a tie and you'll stop and ask him for directions or he'll light your cigarette for you he's by himself or hiding in a group in your lover's pants or in a fly in your soup his cufflinks jingle when he struts he'll let you in even if he hates your guts no need to be afraid of dying if it's love you want but you can't face it without trying we all want love his suit fits him poorly his pants are too tight he'll come looking for you in the still of the night at the foot of your bed his beard tickles your toes he'll take you away to where nobody goes","topic":"Poetic","mood":"Intense","beard":"Clean","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Synths","background":"#ffcce1","tags":["Rock","Dark","Heavy","Distortion"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-23"},{"number":267,"year":"1","youtubeId":"HS9BlNSCmw8","title":"The Three Rules of the internet","description":"Count 'em...1, 2, 3!","topic":"Internet","mood":"Silly","beard":"Shadow","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Synths","background":"#ffcce2","tags":["Folk","Funny","Nerd","Redux"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-24"},{"number":268,"year":"1","youtubeId":"woCjVts5-Ug","title":"Death in Every instant","description":"A poem my grandmother wrote.","topic":"Grandma","mood":"Chill","beard":"Clean","location":"Berkeley","instrument":"Samples","background":"#ffcce3","tags":["Spoken word","Wistful","Delicate"],"releasedAt":"2009-09-25"},{"number":269,"year":"1","youtubeId":"DOp7RuJggdc","title":"Scary Hill","description":"They called it scary hill and we were all afraid They called it scary hill as we sledded through the day Sliding down too fast you'll end up in the creek You'd end up Scary hill and joint the other souls Wheel barrow wood tabagon doing barrel rolls Snow face misplaced among the evergreens And every halloween The adults would make a scene The things we didn't see That frightened me the most Grapes like eyeballs Witches making catcalls But down on scary hill there's some kind of ghost Singing Do you know me Yes I know you Will you follow me up the hill?

Who are all these college kids on youtube, doing crazy tricks with ping pong balls? Why dont they do something to improve their lives? Or the lives of humankind. They could bake cookies for their grandmothers, or learn to play the accordion. Or teach ballet to inner city kids, in their free time. I know what your going to say, who the fuck am I to judge anyone else, And what have I ever done, thats worth a shit? Believe it or not the person Im disappointed in the most, is myself. I sleep too late and my hygienes not that good Ive played video games since I was ten and Ive never really saved the world, I know my chances of doing something great are getting fewer, Every time I play bioshock. Ive never watched the sunset with a child, or comforted a burn victim, in ICU. I drink too much and Im so afraid of being alone and dying. My only legacy a waste of space, another masturbator. was Gandhi ever bummed about all the time he spent weaving, Or just staring at the moon. Would Miamoto Musashi have written the five rings if he played grand theft auto? Dont get me wrong, I think the pong tricks are cool, and I cant imagine How hard they are to do.
