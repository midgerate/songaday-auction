65,The History of Tetris! In song!!,"Hello, my name is Alexey Pajitnov
I like to play games
Oh it really gets me off
But where I live they don’t like let you play
I’m a computer engineer
I just sit and work all day
One day while I was working an idea struck me there
I saw those shapes a’fallin made up of four squares
Aha! I know what joy that brought me
I programmed it right onto my electronica 60
Well a friend imports the game to his IBM PC
It started to spread around most unbeknownst to me
It made its way to Budapest via commodore 64
And that’s when the problems start ah borshamore 

First there’s Robert Maxwell who’s working with Robert Stein
They represent several companies and they want what is mine
They get the computer rights but then I don’t see a dime
They come back for the arcade rights and I say, “Not this time!”
Meanwhile Maxwell’s companies are going Tetris wild
To Japan and North America, they spread the rights with guile
But soon they made mistakes, granting overlapping rights
The game is in the middle of an international fight
Meanwhile, Nintendo’s making Gameboy and they need that killer app
So Henk Rogers contacts Stein, but Stein don’t give a crap
So Henk flies to Moscow to get the handheld rights himself
And then Stein hears about it and heads over there as well

Well Rogers sees me first, I like him right away
I grant him the handheld rights, but he has more to say
He shows me the game on Nintendo’s Famicon
Which is being sold by Tengen, a clear violation
Well Rogers is shock
He got the rights from Stein
Stein was being shady, and it wasn’t his first try
Rogers writes a check for every copy sold
He proved to Mother Russia that he had a heart of gold
At this point in the story, well the rest of you can guess
Gameboy is released to unparalleled success
Thanks in no small part to a game that we all love
That game of course is Tetris, by me, Alexey Pajitnov"

#109! For this song, I took language directly from the torture memos. Lyrics below.

the detainee is lying on a gurney
that's inclined at an angle: 10 to 15 degrees
a cloth is placed over the detainee's face
cold water is poured on the cloth

the wet cloth creates
a barrier through which
it is difficult or in some cases not possible
for the detainee to breathe

if the detainee 
makes an effort to defeat the technique 
by twisting his head to the side and breathing
out the corner of his mouth
the interrogator may cup his hands around 
the detainees nose and mouth
in which case it would not be posible for him to breathe!

As we explained 
in the Section 2340A Memorandum, 
""pain and suffering"" 
(as used in Section 2340) 
is best understood as a single concept, 
not distinct concepts 
of ""pain"" as distinguished from ""suffering""... 

The waterboard,
which inflicts no pain or actual harm whatsoever, 
does not, in our view inflict ""severe pain or suffering"". 
Even if one were to parse the statute more finely 
to treat ""suffering"" as a distinct concept, 
the waterboard could not be said to inflict severe sufering. 

The waterboard is simply a controlled acute episode, lacking the connotation of a protracted period of time generally given to suffering."

I gave an interview today with Middle East Broadcasting Networks, an Arabic Language, Federally funded, web-based tv station that broadcasts to the Middle East, North Africa and Europe: www.alhurra.com 

The correspondent interviewing me really wanted me to write a song that would ""be of interest to Arabic speaking people"".

 I've always wanted to write a song about Israel and Palestine. but when it came time for the interview, I hadn't written anything yet. It's such a huge topic. I didn't really know where to start. He was a little disappointed. He asked me if I could write something for him anyway, on the spot, ""take your time"", he said. 

This is what I came up with. Lyrics below:
when your family's been fighting so long
that they've forgotten why they fight
and they don't know how to stop
two brothers at each other's throats
and neither of them can see
that the blood they shed's the same

tell me what can do you?
so your family sees they're hurting you
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
I am israel
I am paestine 

If your family is steeped in fear
so that the fear is all there is
tell me who will intervene?
When an eye is worth an eye
and the wounds run so deep
and all you want is peace

tell me what can do you?
so your family sees they're hurting you
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
I am israel
I am paestine 

When your family has crossed a line
so that every boundaries blurred
who will stand aside?
when both side knows they're right
and they've forgotten why they fight
and the blood they shed''s the same"
110,Just like the title says.,"#111! Just like the title says. Here's the lyrics:
it was only 72 years ago
the federal government suddenly said no more
No more Cannabis
No more hemp
And since that fateful day
They've shown nothing but contempt

And the story is a very simple one
Full of greed and bigotry and ambition 
It's about hemp vs. nylon
And William Randolph Hearst
And a guy named Harry J. Anslinger

If you know anyone that smokes the stuff
You know it's harmless as can be
But our drug war will never get enough
Until every one is rounded up and locked up for eternity

First we have the company called DuPont
They invented nylon
Hemp can do what nylon does
and do it clean and cheap
So DuPont wanted to see it outlawed

Add to this Harry J. Anslinger
He was the first commissioner
of the Federal Bureau of narcotics
He set his sights on cannabis
as an easy way to prove his effectiveness

You see, he characterized it as a dangerous drug
as for proof he pointed to those who used it most
which at that time was Mexican workers
and black jazz musicians
clearly, this drug had to be stopped

In steps William Randolph Hearst
Who makes Rupert Murdoch look like a saint
In every newspaper he owned
He very clearly showed
How cannabis was the most lethal thing around

If you know anyone that smokes the stuff
You know it's harmless as can be
But our drug war will never get enough
Until every one is rounded up and locked up for eternity

72 years later it's just a fact
Pot is a dangerous drug as simple as that
Hemp's the same as pot
And if you disagree you're either a hippy
Or your some lunatic fringe wacko liberal fool

But I say no to your silly outdated laws
I say yes to the very reasonable cause
I'll knit you something out of hemp
Maybe a scarf or a hat or sweater 
And then we can all get high and watch the sunset together!"

What are they gonna do?

What are they gonna do?

Then they came for the torrent sites
But still I was not moved
They said file sharing is illegal
I didn't believe them, but what could i DO

Net Neutrality has nothing to do with me

Next they constricted bandwidth
Which didn't really seem fair
I never use that much bandwidth anyway
So why should I care?

What are they gonna do?
It's not like they can shut off the tubes

Next they came for youtube
and other video sharing sites

came crashing down overnight

finally they came for me
and my little 'ol site

Nicer when the sun sets
chased by korgano the moon

deep down she was warm inside

far above the farmer's wife an eagle was flying
deep in the brush there were eyes blinking wide
she felt as though the forest were leaning down on her
all bending towards the Rose of Hillside

there is a town not far from here called alpha omega
where the buildings are as tall as the streets are wide

know each other

on me and you

we die so she can live

have nothing left to gives

I just  couldn't dance
When it mattered the most
I froze: I split the party into two
I caused the tide to rise
Behind two brown eyes
As hard as I tried
I couldn't change the scene
Magnets and gravity
And the whole room is mad at me

somethings you just can't change
sometimes it's hard to move

A windowless room
An ungrateful groom
Too soon: Fingers twisted into knots
Lightning struck the church
When prayer doens't work
You're left knives and forks
I felt like a jerk
 Magnets and gravity
And the whole room is mad at me 

please please

none of this was sinister hey
we're all friends here
coats and jackets coming off
mouths and guns were going off
40 tons of soul were spilling out into the room

and i'm gonna sweep
up this mess
just as soon as i sleep
for 24 hours straight

My heart heart wouldn't beat
And I couldn't speak 
My teeth were littering the floor
and just as i heard my name
that's when she came
inevitable as rain
Tears came out in waves
I knew I couldn't stay 
Or i'd be swept away

trees growing out the floor
flames spilling in the door
a hot wind blew
eagles flew up over head
i heard a voice not what it said
but it was you

a bluebird was singing
my ears were ringing
i looked: but you weren't there"

Yes I know you
You are the reason I can't sit still
I hear the rustling
See my breath
And I won't follow you up the hill

But I'll present you king tree queen
Listen to the rustling of their leaves"

wondering where julie was i wished only for a clock
the sun was all obscured by a dark and massive flock
of parrots who spoke to me in their flight

at the top of mount mcormish i stopped surveyed the land
it would have helped to know what to do, to have some kind of plan
as it was i stepped so blindly, leading with my hands
could i speak the word

a terror struck me in my heart like i had never felt
and just as strong and quick the world began to melt
i found myself in an empty space void of heaven or of hell
but in my head i heard"

 in the deep dark depths the humming vacuum, outer space
there's a creature who's wandering all over the place
it doesn't know where it came from, it doesn't know where it's been
a proto sort of consiousness that lives in the moment

after a long time wandering, how long we'll never know
the creature meets something out as far as it can go
at the edge of the universe, it's consciousness expands
and the creature starts to falling, and starts to understand

as it becomes aware, it knows possibilities
and an overwhelming emptiness as far it can see
but it names itself and all around it big and small
the dark he calls space and himself he calls fall

along with his name he's found utter loneliness
the desire for a friend and some companionship
he starts to make sounds he's calling out in all directions
when he hears nothing back he starts getting desperate

one day not long from now Fall will hear an answer back
an old TV program will pierce the black
excited and amazed he'll start heading for it
he's not afraid of anything, he's thrilled to explore it"

close my eyes

wakefulness and sleep 
is the very best time for free association
and most of my ideas
the ones i throw away and keep
come in the shower between exfoliations 
not on the mountain top in mediation
no not at all

and religion didn't mix
and so they built corporate mega churches
jesus said that being poor
was the the only way to live

than being poor

manifestation

a year spent in prison
locked up not suppressed

to the room he called home
did he prefer company
or did he like to be alone?

we got trains we got planes
we got boats bikes and cars

and you flip on the light

number one is easy
use canvas bags
paper or plastic?
that choice is such a drag

number two if you forget
to bring them to the store
reuse the bags that you bring home
they're still useful evermore

number 3 don't want to see
your food scraps go to waste
if you compost them

the rock he brings to her as proof is proof enough but still
he can't fly
can't fly 
penguins don't fly
opening between the best and worst of times the time has nothing
to say
burying beneath the sand a head of fear and shame and gutless guilt 
she can't fly
ostrich can't fly
contribution complicated by the inner critic hating all 
and more
wheels turn among the song of children playing in the park the sky
look up in the sky
humans can fly"

my love lay slain by a snake in a field
and i vowed to bring her back by any strength that i wield 
no mere death won't stop me for my love is pure and hot
and beside my music my love is all i got

so i set out to locate those tunnels leading deep
and i came upon the river styx where the boatman earns his keep
and even as he barred my way with staff and coin and ring
i brought up my ukulele and i started to sing

and the face it spoke with words so cold and bleak

you words move me not nor your song, i see your thought

I was super inspired when I saw Merton's now-famous Chatroulette Improv Piano video last week. I had a kind of ""why didn't I think of that!"" moment, and immediately wondered what I could do to sort of build on his idea. And after seeing his interview on Mashable, I knew I had to make a tribute to him. He's really an awesome guy. A lot of what he said there resonated with me, especially the bit about knowing from the start that he didn't want to be mean. ""Mean"" (or sarcastic, ironic, sardonic, etc) is the default position of so many people on the internet; it's nice to see someone who not only thinks that should change, but seems to be embodying that change himself. That's what I aspire to in general, and with Song A Day specifically. 

Improvisation is not really my strong suit. I'm not terrible at it, but I'm a songwriter first and that's how I tend to frame the music I make. After about 2 straight hours of improvisation (which was an exhilarating experience, really, and I'm bound to do it a bunch more), I met Zach and Cloe. After getting to know them a bit, I was able to hit on a structure around which I could build a song. I then took that raw audio file, brought it into Record (the music making program I use) and did what I do daily: produced the song out a bit. 

I really hope you enjoy it. Especially Merton! If he sees it.

What I got in the end is Song A Day #449: Zach and Cloe, Improv Tribute to Merton","NOTE: I'm in a video contest, please vote for me! http://ow.ly/1qlPp

A lot of what he said there resonated with me, especially the bit about knowing from the start that he didn't want to be mean. ""Mean"" (or sarcastic, ironic, sardonic, etc) is the default position of so many people on the internet; it's nice to see someone who not only thinks that should change, but seems to be embodying that change himself. That's what I aspire to in general, and with Song A Day specifically. 

Improvisation is not really my strong suit. I'm not terrible at it, but I'm a songwriter first and that's how I tend to frame the music I make. After about 2 straight hours of improvisation (which was an exhilarating experience, really, and I'm bound to do it a bunch more), I met Zach and Cloe. After getting to know them a bit, I was able to hit on a structure around which I could build a song. I then took that raw audio file, brought it into Record (the music making program I use) and did what I do daily: produced the song out a bit. 

I really hope you enjoy it. Especially Merton! If he sees it.

What I got in the end is Song A Day #449: Zach and Cloe, Improv Tribute to Merton"

it's a tower made of clouds
and it's power rings out over creation 
meanwhile on the ground

break upon the backs of stale frustration

rub their eyes

no melody or words
could have cut quite like the sword
swung by the hand of evolution
to live and grow and die
without ever knowing why
knowing how to ask but finding no solution
calling it divine retribution

and her power sent out waves upon the pavement
i pulled over then and there
i had to catch my breath
and stare in this delicate amazement 
i felt utterly exposed, stripped naked
to the bone

when she came up to the car
and asked, ""do you know where we are?""
i couldn't tell if she was serious or joking
i tried to say yes
and planet earth, i guess
but the sounds out of my mouth were more like choking
in the distance some peeper frogs were croaking
to the moon

we were married
it was the first of may

the entire way
it was scary
but it was the best day of my life

and in that drawer is a list of all my worries
it's an illustrated list
with notes an annotations
and entries like nature's wrath and fury
and brain aneurysms from being in a hurry
i eat too fast

sometimes i go to sleep 
thinking i'll never wake
is it only in my mind these thoughts are turning
or do i die every night
to be revived by the light
of the tower in the clouds softly burning
and the pitter patter of the rain finally returning
as it hits the glass

out the window
the sky is overcast
if i could fly i'd follow birds
on their lonely paths
but i swallow all my pills
and am fading fast 
close my eyes

i find the space between
wakefulness and sleep 
is the very best time for free association
and most of my ideas

come in the shower between exfoliations

the answer seems obvious and yet i think it's wrong

does he have the answers to interstellar flight
is cold fusion just something that he figured out one night
does he think a lot about what everything is worth
does he think at all about being ruler of the earth

i'm so fascinated by steve jobs you might say obsessed
so rarely does one exist that clearly is the best
he's the best at what he does though i can hardly define what it is and what he has

there's an awful lot of hoopla
around the iphone 4 anttenna 
when you grip it with the death grip
and you're call slips away

the media loves a failure
in a string of success
the facts won't ever matter
if they can make bigger messes

sure i can make it happen
but in terms of daily usage
i've yet to drop a call
so this whole damn thing is stupid

and you can call me a fanboy
i've been called worse things
but gizmodo just ridiculous
pulling their anti-apple strings

you bought a stolen prototype
get over it and move on

as business men go he is a legend
surviving exile returning as king
if that sounds like moses it's no accident
the cult of macintosh is a religion
we bow down to products that make us weep
the beauty of simplicity the shepard and his sheep
we defend all attackers with fervent zeal
in each operating system some new truth is revealed

his violent temper, his strict beliefs
his singular vision make him adored
we try our best as we make our way
through the pipeline of products we can't afford
in his guarded temple there's a beating drum
and it's made of glass and of aluminum
on every surface a mysterious brew
a reflection of desire is forged anew

when he speaks we all listen
lovers and haters  
the excitement that i feel when he walks out on stage
it's not just what he's revealing but the way he reveals it too","Song starts at 0:46

We're staying at the Green Tortoise hostel (if you're around, come say hello!), and I recorded this on my iPhone 4 (with the front facing camera) in my bunk. As is often the case when traveling, I was only able to get one take. We don't have a private room, and folks were coming in and out, making it difficult to really go all out. But Song-a-day is all about making the song where and when I can, no matter the conditions. I'm a little out of tune here, but it's nothing serious (I hope!). 

Anyway, I wanted to write a song that really reflected how I feel about PAX. I've only been one other time (three years ago), but it was by far the best convention I'd ever been to (and as GameJew, I went to a lot). It's kind of cliche by now to say it, but this really is the gamer's convention: By gamers, for gamers. There is a palpable sense of family here, that you can just strike up a conversation with anyone you meet, and they could become your lifelong friend. It's almost like summer camp in that way.

Lyrics:

'Twas the night before pax and all through Seattle
Every manner of nerd was preparing for battle
Polishing dice and spit shining controllers
From  d n d nerds all the way to wii bowlers

Oh pax is for gamers
It's where we belong
At pax we're not ashamed, no
From ducklings into swans

'Twas the night before pax
And the city exciting
New friends on the street
Old friends reuniting
From near and from far
We answer the call
Head down to gameworks
Happy hour for all

Oh I can't wait to see Warren Spector tomorrow
And all the panels and the talks
Our Weekend will be Confirmed
I wanna see the Protomen rock
Jonathan coulton and Frontalot...and don't forget the Minibosses

Wanna walk the show floor and be bombarded with swag
Wanna game until I've had my fill
Wanna fall asleep in a big bean bag
Wanna meet a Wheaton named Wil!!

At pax we are family
Thats the way it is
We're the best that we can be
Together just like this","So! We made it to Seattle. I came up with the title for this while driving the 3 hours up from Portland.

Song A Day #620

Dmaj  Gmaj  
I dreamt that waves of empty parking lots
Amaj
Were suddenly filled with blood
Out of rotting supermarkets
Lines of dancing food
Bmin Gmaj
Kittens purred
Bmin  Amaj
A tornado stirred
Dmaj   Amaj
And no one knew what to do
The rain was splashing down
On the hoods of abandoned cars
A man with baggy jeans
Stood repeating the word ""guitar""
Lightning struck him
He became tur-duck-en
And no one
Knew what to do

Dmaj  Gmaj Amaj
It's the end of the world dance
The apocalyptic romance
Bmin  Gmaj
When all the snowmen melt
Bmin  Amaj
And the sun leaves gaping welts
Dmaj Amaj  Dmaj
And no one knows what to do

Dairy cows kill farmers
Pigs eat human flesh
When asked if they enjoy it
They answer more or less
And explosion, a sigh
An archangel in the sky
And no one knew what to do

Jesus cam and said ""yep
It's all according to plan
Four horsemen were there
Singing songs
Written by Jonathan Mann
Aliens watched
Sipping 20-year old scotch
And no one knew what to do

It's the end of the world dance
The apocalyptic romance
When all the snowmen melt
When the sun leaves gaping welts
And no one knows what to do

A pile of men was burning
In the middle of a field
Another pile of men
Was using the first pile as a shield
Bitter bold
Thunder rolled
And no one knew what to do

Some hid under rocks
Some hid underground
As the ocean riding tide
And the waves began to pound
Sky fell
The earth swelled
And no one knew what to do

It's the end of the world dance
The apocalyptic romance
When all the snowmen melt
When the sun leaves gaping welts
And no one knows what to do


Computers came to life
And started taking over
I saw a man get sucked
Into a leaf blower
Sirens wailed
The internet failed
And no one knew what to do

Religious wars all ended
And everyone got along
The melody of Armageddon
Was their dying song
Horses neighed
The band played
And no one knew what to do

It's the end of the world dance
The apocalyptic romance
When all the snowmen melt
When the sun leaves gaping welts
And no one knows what to do

Hell was filling up
And heaven overflowed
Neither of them were built
To carry such a load
Out of space
The human race
And no one knew what to do

Bodies floating freely
Out among the stars
Winter vines and hydrogen cells
Mixed with electric cars
Nowhere to go
With your family in tow
And no one knew what to do

It's the end of the world dance
The apocalyptic romance
When all the snowmen melt
And the sun leaves gaping welts
And no one knows what to do

Pumpkins and bananas fought
On the steps of Capitol Hill
A police officer came up
As his guts began to spill
Banana won
And he set off towards the sun
And no one knew what to do

Animals and machines
Started mating wildly
Mechanized rhinoceroses 
To put it mildly
Robo-giraffe
Mecha-hyena laugh
And no one knew what to do

It's the end of the world dance
The apocalyptic romance
When all the snowmen melt
When the sun leaves gaping welts
And no one knows what to do

Well I toiled in the bank vault
But my heart was in a storm
Though each limb was cold
My center was still warm
I felt her touch
She popped the clutch
And no one knew what to do

Riding in the backseat
I slept until I woke
The air was hot and stuffy
Dark and filled with smoke
My home was gone
The road stretched on
And no one knew what to do

Original video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCE_qiy-sOQ

This is my first ever attempt at auto-tuning. I'm a huge fan of the Auto-Tune the News guys (and gal) the Gregory Brothers. They are so amazingly talented. I've often thought about trying it myself and using it as a song-a-day video.

I know that there were probably going to be dozens  (if not more) auto-tune versions of this video, and I wanted to see if I could be the first. So it was created in 3 hours. Even if it's not the best (which I'm sure it won't be!), at least it'll be the first! Which maybe counts for something? Maybe the song should have been longer! Oh well. 

It seems to me that in some ways this is actually a really difficult video to auto-tune. There's a TON of background noise, and there are multiple ""singers"" all speaking over each other. I wonder how other folks are going to handle this issue.

If you want to do a remix, it's actually really simple. There's only 4 chords the whole time: Am-G-F-E    a classic chord progression. The main guy just happened to be speaking mostly in Am. I made it slow because I thought that kind of fit the mood of the tornado somehow. 

Also, if you're the dudes in the video, please contact me!

Enjoy!

LYRICS:
What the fuck?
Holy shit!
(Tornado mother fucker!)

Oh my god I'm gonna get nailed!
Oh my god, oh my god

Dude, dude, dude, dude here it comes!
(what the fuck?!)

Holy fuck! Holy shit!
Get inside now go!
hahahaha!

My second attempt at auto-tuning! Original video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnKfLVyHu_E

I really love this video. The sheer joy and happiness is infectious. I found this video slightly easier to auto-tune, due to Oprah's voice being so clear (for the most part). I made the decision early on in the process (read: this morning) that I'd just attempt to auto-tune the screaming crowd as well. I'm not sure if that worked so well, but it's interesting for the song-dynamic. Oprah sings, crowd sings, kinda.","Download this song: http://jonathanmann.bandcamp.com/track/oprah-autotuned

In the space 
Where the military asks him
To hold
Our core American values
He instead holds and harbors hate (hate!)
And he gets to stay and fight for our country

Should soldiers and the goverment
Be able to pick and choose
What we are fighting for?

She allegedly hired two gunmen, trading sex for their services, to come into her home and kill her husband and step-son. She also allegedly offered up sex with her 16 year old daughter as collateral for the job.The point of this song is that no human, or group of humans, should be able to take another human's life. They just shouldn't. If she indeed did what they say she did, life in prison would have been an adequate sentence. Killing her solves absolutely nothing. Her daughter, the family member left to grieve, will never have a chance to fully forgive her mother. I find that the saddest part.","Teresa Lewis was the second woman to be put to death by the state of Virginia since 1912. She died on September 23rd 2010.

nothings ever the same","well it was 1986
in my babysitter's basement
the glow of the tv
kept me staring in amazment
my brother had atari
but this was something different
and i knew right then
what i would want for christmas

it was the day after christmas
i'm almost 5 years old
and the sight of  mario
is something to behold
i can barely even play it
can barely hold the controller
but i play it anyway
over and over

nes, nes
i say yes
i say yes

i'm 28 now and i still play games
but compared to those memories
nothings ever the same"

For those that didn't see, Conan O'Brien and his staff did this amazing thing today where they set up a webcam in a hallway and streamed for 24 hours. It was awesome and surreal, just as you'd expect from them. A lot of it was just looking at a typical office hallway with random people milling about. Sometimes there were little moments of excitement. ; They had this weird ethereal music playing...I loved that part. I decided I'd write my song a day for them today, and I just randomly started capturing footage.

I stumbled on to a really wonderful thread on Reddit.com about the most mind blowing facts people could think of. I collected a bunch of them and made this song!

Lyrics:

There are more atoms in a single glass of water 
than glasses of water in the oceans of the Earth
A blue whales heart is the size of a VW Beetle 
and you could swim through its arteries

An adult human has two to nine pounds of bacteria in his or her body

Cleopatra lived closer in time to the first moon landing
than to the building of the Great Pyramid
54 million people alive right now will 
be dead within 12 months.

fold over a piece of paper 42 times and it will reach the moon

what a mad, mad world
what a wonderfully nutty universe
what a glorious space to dwell
what a blessing and what a curse

Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, 
given enough time thinks about itself.
The chances are high that 120 years from now, I will not be thought of daily. 
Just another person who lived on Earth.

You see your nose at all times, your brain just chooses to ignore it.

Optimus Prime and Eeyore were the same guy. 
Same with Megatron and Scooby Do
Duck Hunt is two player
A controller in port 2 controls the ducks.

Blue whale is more closely related to a cow, than a cow is to a horse.

what a mad, mad world
what a wonderfully nutty universe
what a glorious space to dwell
what a blessing and what a curse

The age of the observable universe is 13.7 billion years, but it's a sphere with a radius of 46.5 billion lightyears.

Each ejaculation has more sperm than there are people in the united states.
One in 5000 babies are born without an anus It's called Imperforate Anus.

Our concept of ""reality"" exists solely in our brain.","Donate to Song A Day: http://patreon.com/jonathanmann

i'm at tedmed
in a fancy hotel 
sitting on a fancy bed
so far it's been great
in fact inspiring and grand
so many experts
so much to understand

first there was charity
an amazing opera singer
she had a double lung transplant a year ago
the story of her illness
and of her recovery
and the fact of her up on the stage all aglow
she blew my mind

next up was a pig lung
in this crazy machine
that keeps lungs alive for translpants 
martha stewart touched the pig lung
apparently it's really soft
i didn't get to touch it, maybe tomorrow

next up was rick
and he had these awesome pictures
showing various medical techniques across the years
he pointed out how the things
we think of as bleeding edge now
will seem so quaint 
in no time at all

up next came nathan
who had this amazing idea
of hospitals that always clean themselves 
he's also finished a cookbook
written from scientific perspective
which looked totally rad and i may have to buy

then was nathan wolfe
who tracks viruses globally
he was really scary and reassuring
at the same time
first to know that the viruses
are out there waiting for us
but also that really smart people are paying attention

next was eric mead
a funnyman magician
he did a trick that involved
his thumbs stuck together with medical tape
and then getting medical tubing
to go off and on his wrists it's hard to explain
but it was really cool!
and i love magic!!

next to last was jay walker
who has the world's greatest library
he showed us 500 year old medical books
he talked about imagination 
and how important that it is
and boy i couldn't agree more

finally jill sobule
came on and sang a song
about lame skanky costumes for haloween
then later on at dinner
i got to hang out with jill
and it was really great i even met her mom!;2","And it's fun!

I didn't get to go to the rally, but I watched I live online. It was pretty amazing. I especially loved Jon Stewart's final speech! 

Anyway, I found these pictures on Buzzfeed, where they have a collection of the 100 best signs. http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-100-best-signs-at-the-rally-to-restore-sanity

who would jesus bomb? i'm pretty sure that god hates us all equally
i understand your stance and while i disagree i'm pretty sure you're not a nazi!

i already regret choosing to carry a sign around all day
i'm mad as hell but mostly in a passive aggressive way 

i like turtles!
my arms are tired
use your inside voice
jesus says relax

don't feed the trolls
don't be a douche
i want a sandwich
eat some sushi!

the death star was an out side job
humpty dumpty was pushed!
wwopd
if you keep shouting like that, 
you'll get big muscles all over your face
my president is black this sign is blue

sweet succulent jesus give me sanity
under appreciated super heroes for sanity
confused senior citizens for sanity
retired cia analyst for sensible drug policy

i hate taxes 
but i like roads, 
firemen, 
some cops, 

traffic lights, 
national parks, 
the coast guard so i pay them anyway! 
oh yeah i hate war too!

#1 threat to america gay mexican muslim bears!
gay bearrorist!
bears are people too!
this sign is too damn big!
and take it off caps lock 

 am i acting suspicious?
where are the moderate muslims? right here.
lions and tigers and muslims ohmy

I fought nazi's and they don't look like obama
toasters united against teabaggers

obama is not the devil, i am
we should do this more often  
even my sign chooses not to yell

god hates times new roman!
pasta fearing american
i'm moderate and i'm mad as hell

ain't no party like a mr. t party
i like tea and you're kind of ruining it

i want more torillas when i order fajitas at a restaurant
is this the line for justin bieber tickets?

you say waffling like it's a bad thing! waffles are delicious!
somewhat irritated about extreme outrage

Johannes, Johannes mehserle 
your case is the face of injustice 
you murdered a man and soon will be free
it's broken and bitter corruption 

you graduated top of your class
academically amazing 
in the heat of the moment you grabbed your gun
when you thought you were grabbing your taser

so you made a mistake
so you made a mistake
and somebody died 
it must keep you awake
if anyone else 
were to make that mistake
they'd spend their life in prison

but you were a cop
and that's worth a lot
and he was a black man in oakland
so your chief can just talk
to the judge and you walk
in two years you're out in the open

is one man's life worth more than another's?
this seems to be the message
a cop, a cop who breaks the law
remains underpunished 

it's not hard to see what's right and what's fair
we all know it inside our bones

""The treehouse was built for me and my brother by my dad. It was actually more like a fort - with metal bars you climbed up to get to the 2nd story - which had a railing all around. Then - you could exit from the top by sliding down a fireman's pole, or... climbing down a long, knotted rope.

On the other side of the structure were two hella long swings! The whole thing was built on the side of a hill, so you could swing waaaaaay out over the hill and jump off the swing, HIGH in the air and fall into leaves at the bottom of the hill. But it was very simple, architectural. Image attached.

About two years later, the next-door neighbors built a super fancy hi-tech treehouse even higher up, in a real tree, next door. It had carpet, electricity - really swanky. BUT they were very stingy about sharing it, and it always felt a bit too high up, too scary. 

I still think ours was better. It was more like a sculpture you could play on, and it was open to everyone. It had symmetry, and class. It was a real testament to how much our dad loved us and wanted us to have fun - and also, his engineering mind. Maximum fun, minimum materials.. and still as strong the day we moved out as the day he built it.  ""","A request from my friend Robin!

you went to the supermarket got your turkey wrapped in plastic
cooked it in the oven just right should come out fantastic
the whole family's coming over you put on your evening gown
but creeping up behind you all moist and golden brown 
it's the zombie turkey coming to pay you back

you run up the stairs into the bathroom lock the door
you can hear her boney legs banging on the floor
she's coming ever closer now, you look out the window to see
an entire neighborhood overrun by zombie turkeys
they are zombie turkeys and they're coming to pay you back

she's banging down the door now it looks like there's no escape
you can't outrun her because you're fat and out of shape
if only you exercised more, ate less, you'd be thinner
what a terrible way to die to be eaten by your dinner
by a zombie turkey who has come to pay you back","Leave a comment or email if you want to help with the video!

abilities are nothing
it's the choices that we make
working on the side of good
and he almost cracked a rib
as he hugged me and he said
i love you little squib"

a song about the new life form discovered by nasa...alien bacteria that uses arsenic instead of﻿ phosphorous.

little tiny microbes at the bottom of a lake
tiny but significant make no mistake
arsenic arsenic in their DNA
maybe life's more prevalent then we thought yesterday
Maybe life's on the moon
Maybe life's on mars
Maybe in a vacuum
is there life on stars?

the rulebook has been busted
now all bets are off

life everywhere you look
aliens that look like a sci fi book
life in every nook
you can't stop life 
you can't stop life

life is everything","RNAdancer

Hi, Jonathan! Please write a song about rabbits who﻿ cut the grass all day long! They live in a dark blue forest and they are very afraid of wolves and owls! And that would not be afraid, they always sing songs :)
Thx! And sorry for my English :)
There's a rabbit in the dark blue forest
and she always cuts the grass
Her jaw get sore but she ignores it
For the grass needs cutting alas

wolves in the forest howl
owls in the forest hoot
but to the rabbit the wolves and owls
barely constitute 

but a minor distraction
because the real action
is in the songs that the rabbit sings
to the blue birds wings
as the golden rings
of the sun start setting
and the forest blue
is part of me and you
and the rabbit too
set course with the heading
for the dark blue forest
on the way to better better
always everything is growing 
of you

there's a rabbit  in the dark blue forest
and she always gets away
from the owls and the wolves with their chorus
of come and be our dinner today

look inside your heart and tug it
you will see a rabbit there
under every rock a bug, it's
a scary little piece of spare

parts for the machine
but the real meaning","GaricST

maybe write a song about stallking a girl you like and it could be called orbiting your earth like a satalite


I am orbiting your earth like a satellite
You don't know im here but I'm visible at night
I get a little closer with each revolution
And a restraining order is just a stop gap solution

Because i'm on the wind that's blowing outside your door
I'm in the light that's glowing from that candle on the floor
Im in the water flowing as you draw a bath
I'm a hurricane a coming and your the aftermath

Hear my satellite  beeping
As the moon comes creeping overhead
As I watch you sleeping
My feelings deepen
I wish I could be steeped in your bed

But you don't know that I exist
And I'm doomed to float around you like this

A man desires love and he hates to be alone
He wants to love before his heart has turned to stone
Elves are dancing and singing in his head
In a fantastic wedding with dwarves baking bread

Somewhere there's someone looking in on you
He may not look like much but his heart is strong and true
Mistakes have been made, paths have diverged
And he's ready to talk to you with just a bit more courage","mespin459

A song of the life of the red plastic cups you always see people drinking out﻿ of at parties.
i was born in a factory
i looked around and saw a million others like me
and i knew that this was gonna be my life
not a single quality about me that i like
and i knew that i would get away
i knew that i be myself someday

i was packed up and shipped 
with 20 of my brothers pushed up against my ribs
from the cold steel rooms i called home
to a dark and musty truck crowded but alone
i ended up on some brightly lighted shelf
and i knew that someday i would be myself

some kids came in one day and bought me
i was scanned and paid for was 2 dollars thirty
before i knew it i was filled up with beer
and then i was discarded and filled up with fear
people dancing everywhere i was almost crushed
someone kicked me out the door and i felt blessed with good luck

cause then i was struck with lightening
and i grew legs for walking
and hands for manipulating 
and i grew lips for talking

and i went inside and told those kids
that life was a precious, precious thing
and after they all stopped screaming
then we all started dancing!","Destin777

Since you'll be doing some driving, how about a﻿ song about the guy who paints the lines on the road?
I'm the guy who paints the lines on the road
i try to paint them straight but sometimes i go
into a kind of trance i get lost in the repetition
with each line i paint some sin will be forgiven

i spent 3 years at an art school in the city
but they said painting was dead and that my work was shitty
i started to get conceptual until i didn't know what was real
i dropped out my senior year and got behind the wheel

now if you pass me on the road you may look down on me
my work will never show up in your fancy gallery
i'll never have an opening with cheese and expensive wine
art collectors scoff at my endless rows of lines

but every single line has more meaning lying there
than all the pieces being created in every art school everywhere
every single museum and every gallery show
couldn't match the sleeping beauty of my lines upon the road","Spintown7

and harry would be just a normal boy
they would switch roles with on another 

now i'm not saying harry would be neville
but neville would be the chosen one
neville's name in the goblet of fire
as voldemort was trying to get the job done
maybe herbology would still be his thing
and maybe he'd still be a little awkward
but i think he'd have more confidence 
even if he was still a great big nerd

one little step in the other direction
one little change in voldemort's selection
neville woulda had that lightening scar
neville would fought in the old graveyard

back in the 80s at nintendo japan
they though we couldn't handle the real jump man

so they took doki doki panic
and then put mario right in it
and changed a few key elements
to make it more of a mario game
a mushroom here
a warp zone there
the princess with
her golden hair

we were just kids
we didn't know
as far as we were concerned
this was mariorq
it wasn't until
the snes 
the real mario 2
put our skills to the test

man that game is hard
mushrooms fake you out
wind will knock you down
warp zones send you back

withholding this game
was a very good call
we wouldn't have had the princess
after all

and to this day 
i don't know which i prefer
the real mario 2

LYRICS:
in 1987 american airlines saved $40,000 by removing 1 olive from each salad served in first class
Popeye has four nephews and they're names are as follows Pipeye Peepeye Pupeye and then there's poopeye they were in the cartoon but not the comic
 if you yelled for 8 years 7 months and 6 days you will produce enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee
There's a bird in New Zealand called the Kea. It's two feet long and has been known to chew on the rubber strips around car windows

Ain't life wonderful?
Ain't  life grand
You've got 29 bones 
In your hand!

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue
An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain
A pregnant goldfish is called a twit
22 miles an hour can be the speed of rain

It's impossible to sneeze with your eyes open
There are 336 dimples on a golf ball
Clinophobia is the fear of beds
Two thirds of the world's eggplant is grown in new jersey

until the 19th Century large solid bricks of tea were use as currency by China Tibet and Mongolia money you can consume imagine that
The king of hearts is the only king without a mustache on a standard playing card
I wonder if his lip gets cold
It's illegal to drink beer out of a bucket while you're sitting on the curb in St. Louis
It's illegal to chew gum in singapore!
 A jiffy is an actual unit of time it means 1//100th of a second
and the longest known flight of a chicken is 1300 jiffy's 

ain't life wonderful?
It's a mad, mad world
We're mostly water
vinegar dissolves pearls

Forest fires move faster uphill than down hill
America once issued a 5 cent bill
A giraffe can clean it's ear with it's tongue
More people use blue tooth brushes than red ones

Dolphins sleep with one eye open

LYRICS:
in 1987 american airlines saved $40,000 by removing 1 olive from each salad served in first class
Popeye has four nephews and they're names are as follows Pipeye Peepeye Pupeye and then there's poopeye they were in the cartoon but not the comic
 if you yelled for 8 years 7 months and 6 days you will produce enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee
There's a bird in New Zealand called the Kea. It's two feet long and has been known to chew on the rubber strips around car windows

Ain't life wonderful?
Ain't  life grand
You've got 29 bones 
In your hand!

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue
An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain
A pregnant goldfish is called a twit
22 miles an hour can be the speed of rain

It's impossible to sneeze with your eyes open
There are 336 dimples on a golf ball
Clinophobia is the fear of beds
Two thirds of the world's eggplant is grown in new jersey

until the 19th Century large solid bricks of tea were use as currency by China Tibet and Mongolia money you can consume imagine that
The king of hearts is the only king without a mustache on a standard playing card
I wonder if his lip gets cold
It's illegal to drink beer out of a bucket while you're sitting on the curb in St. Louis
It's illegal to chew gum in singapore!
 A jiffy is an actual unit of time it means 1//100th of a second
and the longest known flight of a chicken is 1300 jiffy's 

ain't life wonderful?
It's a mad, mad world
We're mostly water
vinegar dissolves pearls

Forest fires move faster uphill than down hill
America once issued a 5 cent bill
A giraffe can clean it's ear with it's tongue
More people use blue tooth brushes than red ones

Dolphins sleep with one eye open
Porcupines float in water
 Cat urine glows in blacklight
the state of florida's bigger than englad
The electric chair was invented by a dentist
A lightening bolt is hotter than the sun
Everyday 20 banks are robbed
The first product with a bar code was wrigleys gum"

i woke up from a party and looked in to the mirror
and what i saw staring back filled me up with fear
i had a treasure map plastered on my forehead
i knew not how i got it must have been when i was in bed

it seemed to lead me to this tree in a field nearby
i walked there with no shoes on because i didn't have any
i had lost them at the party anyway when i got to the tree
there was a gremlin like creature waiting for me

who dare disturbs me the gremlin creature said
disturbs you i exclaimed i have this map on my forehead
he examined me closely and then took me by the hand
he touched a piece of bark and the tree split in half

hidden within the tree was a door made out of glass
he led me through it and we appeared in a great hall
there were fantastic creatures every which way i looked
this faerie looking woman came and kissed me on my map

at the end of the hall sat a king looking old and wise
he told me that the map was just a hoax 
he said i should probably just turn around and go back now
because there wasn't anything in this world for me anyhow

no i yelled forcefully which made everyone jump a bit
no i said softer i'm happy to have found this place
the faerie looking woman was looking kind but sort of sad
ok said the king we were afraid you would say that

next thing i knew i was in a gladiatorial arena
there was big dragon there and an ostrich for me to ride
i picked up my sword and hopped aboard and slayed the dragon quick as ice
a booming voice came from above and it said very nice

the voice was god and god was glad that i had slayed the dragon
he rewarded me with anything that my little heart desired
to be back in bed i said before the party started
but i want to bring the faeire back because i think she's really cool

723,"There's something about this season that's great for misdirection
You're thinking about something and suddenly reflection
what kind of person am i, what kind do i want to be?
where do i fit in, what's waiting out there for me
and the christmas songs on the radio don't help
and the tinsel lights everywhere you go don't help
and the sounds of sleigh bells ringing don't help
and hark the angel singing definitely doesn't help

christmas pudding
i'll just eat this christmas pudding
I won't overthink it
take this egg nog drink it
christmas pudding
i'll just eat this chirstmas pudding
i don't even know you
but i will mistletoe you

the end of the year approaches and it's time for reassessing
but whether i've grown at all is for anyone to be guessing
there's something in the air that makes me want to change
it's like a mass delusion, we're all feeling kind of strange
and the christmas songs on the radio don't help
and buying gifts for everyone you know don't help
i just want to take a nap but i don't think that would help
cause i'd wake up christmas morning then it's over and it's too late

break out Champagne
food to satiate
the knives are very sharp
someone plays a harp

727,"Did you see the porcupine who is going bald?
He looks like Lee Harvey Oswald 
He's married to a chipmunk who's got a loose tooth
and she looks kind of like John Wilkes Booth

nothing sadder than a bald porcupine
Who dresses up in nice clothes all the time
Goes to the theatre to watch the ballet
And get's assassinated
Up there in heaven he's covered in slime
But that's how it is there all of the time
He walks around naked but with a toupet
And no one calls him crazy

I've got a headache and it won't go away
I feel like Zach Morris at the end of the day
You've got a headache and you feel lousy 
You're feeling kind of like kelly kapowski

nothing sadder than a bald porcupine
Who can't have nice things cuz he don't have the time
who's got two left feet and wants to be dancing
on the floor in the round
out in the world they call him Moonshine
He lives on a commune where they take out your mind
they remove all the parts that identify fancy
and leave you on the ground

728,"I'm so hungry
I haven't eaten for a thousand years
I've cried a thousand blood red tears
And i've wished I would die
The tears fall and stain my feet
Then I faint and hit the cold concrete
I wake up and I'm still alive
And the days go by 

It's a curse, it's a curse
And it's ten times worse
When they carried you out
In the big black hearse
And of course and of course
The pale veiled maker 
Fed you the source  but she made a mistake with you

I'm so lonely
I haven't loved for a thousand years
Shunned by my people with a thousand jeers
They just turn me away
I've wandered far and I've learned much
But all I want is to feel her touch
To be reminded of better days
When I was okay

I'm ashamed
A vampire afraid of blood
It's a bad joke in a comedy club
It's a movie plot
Maybe I should write it down
sell the rights and skip town
Build a space ship and make a straight shot
For some galactic parking lot","I'm so hungry

at how fast each year goes
But the mirror does not reflect
what my self reflection froze

Playing less and working more and more?

I remember being terrified
I remember laughing hard
I've been disconnected

A touch that does reveal a ring

One ring stands out alone
Two rings join and meet
A million rings fade to make
A picture of complete living
