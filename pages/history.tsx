                  During the first few years of Song A Day, I was making my living entering online
                  video contests.
                </Text>

                <Text>
                  One of the contests I entered was a jingle competition for Microsoft’s recently
                  launched search engine, Bing. The Bingle contest was simple: Make the best jingle
                  and video showcasing Bing and win a $500 American Express gift card. It wasn’t a
                  lot of money but the due date was just around the corner, and the contest would be
                  decided by judges, not votes (these were my two biggest requirements for entering
                  a contest) so banged out a song in under an hour and in another 45 minutes
                  had posted my video. Another day, another contest.

                <Text>
                  About a week later, I found out that I won. On the one hand, this was surprising,
                  because I thought that my song and video sucked, but on the other hand, my closest
                  competition was a man staring into the camera singing, “You’ve got to Bing it Bing
                  it, You’ve got to Bing it Bing it.”

                  A few days later, a friend linked me to an article on TechCrunch. MG Siegler, a
                  preeminent tech writer, had written a scathing article with the headline:

                  Now, I’m quite used to being made fun of on the internet. It comes with the
                  territory. The best thing you can do is ignore these types of comments. This was
                  different though. TechCrunch was so high profile and{' '}

                  , and I was feeling pretty down. It also happened to be the eve of Apple’s
                  “Antenna-Gate” press conference. The anti-Apple hype was at a fever pitch, and I
                  thought the whole non-story was ridiculous. I decided to write a song defending
                  Apple. I hoped that MG would post it, and maybe I’d get some decent traffic. I
                  wrote the song in about 2 hours and spent another hour on{' '}

                  The next morning I woke to a flurry of activity in my inbox, including an email
                  that appeared to be from Apple. I read the email and decided it was fake — someone
                  was trolling me. I was in the shower when my phone rang. It was Apple PR. For
                  real. Could they use my video to open the press conference, they wondered? Um,
                  yes. Sure, uh, how should I send it to you? Jesus Christ.

                  Later that morning, I watched online as the song and video I had made in 3 hours
                  the night before played before an audience of journalists at Apple HQ. Then Steve
                  Jobs came out on stage and said, “Thanks for coming. We found that on YouTube this
                  morning and couldn’t help but want to share it.” It was one of the most surreal
                  moments of my life. I heard later from the PR rep that Steve had been dancing off
                  stage as the song played. If you watch the video of the event, there’s a few
                  seconds, right as my song ends, that you can see him bopping his way on to the
                  stage.

                  Eventually, we knew we had to break up, and it was really sad but amicable. At
                  some point, when we were broken up by still living together, I suggested we make a
                  song together, announcing to all our friends and loved ones that we were splitting
                  up. I didn't want to have to explain it over and over to everyone. We'd just make
                  the video, post it to Facebook, and then everyone would know.

                  After we broke up for good, I finally moved out and got my own place. I couldn't
                  afford a Brooklyn apartment on my own, and I was having a really hard time finding
                  a roommate. So of course I wrote another song:

                  I got to Song A Day #2000 right around the time my first child was born. This is
                  the closest I've ever come to quitting. It seemed like the right time: I had an
                  infant son. I was about to hit 2000. It just felt almost cosmic, in a way.

                  After the first debate between Hillary and Trump, I made this song that went
                  incredibly viral - one of my fastest spreading songs ever. It got to 2 million
                  views in a few hours.

                  One of Hillary's dark money PACs even purchased the rights to the song, and they
                  used it in a Snapchat filter they released the day of the election. John Legend
                  posted a video of himself on Twitter using it. I'm pretty sure I cost her the
                  election.

                  In 2016, I hooked up with a really amazing fiction podcast called The Truth to
                  make Songonauts, a podcast about a down-on-their-luck band that finds a magical
                  drum machine that transports them *inside* their songs.

                  It was obvious to me from the moment I saw CryptoPunks that I needed to build
                  something similar with my songs. Music, maybe more than any other medium, has
                  become so devalued in our culture that even bands that "make it" can still
                  struggle to make ends meet through their music alone. You have to hustle from 1000
                  different angles just to cobble together a living. That's where I've been for the
                  entirety of my career.

                  Throughout this process, I also became part of a small cohort of folks obsessed
                  with the idea that would become NFTs.

                  in June of 2018. In October of that year, I performed at Devcon in Prague, the
                  largest Ethereum gathering in the world. I even got Vitalik Buterin to sing:

                  Then I did some hosting duties and performed at ETH Denver in February of 2019:

                  Once the long crypto winter began, and especially once COVID hit, I almost
                  abandoned the idea entirely. My income took a huge hit, I was home with my 2 small
                  children, and I had no extra time to devote to it. Everything stalled.

                  But then things started to pick up again, and I decided to launch the pre-sale,
                  minimum viable version of the project on OpenSea's shared storefront contract. No
                  solidity devs needed!

                  ) have given me the means to finally bring this project to life, exactly as I
                  envisioned it all those years ago.

                  My most viewed, most listened to song ever. Went insanely viral on TikTok. 4.7
                  million streams on Spotify and over 9 million views on YouTube. For a while it was
                  the #1 Viral song on Spotify in a bunch of countries. Most incredibly, I get texts
                  from friends and folks from all over, saying that they overhear their kids and
                  other kids singing it constantly. It truly was a phenomenon.

                  Periodically, I go back through my archive of songs to find the hidden gems. Then
                  I pick them up again, dust them off and work them and rework them until they are
                  as good as I can possibly make them. The last time I did this was in 2019, with
                  this album. I still think it's some of my strongest work.

                  Just as the pandemic hit, I released one season of a podcast that explores the
                  process of making a song from start to finish. I've seen a lot of different
                  approaches to the task of pulling back the curtain on the creative process, and I
                  was determined with this series to make it really dynamic, and fascinating to
                  listen to.

                  Each episode covers the creation of a song from end to end, but I kept each
                  episode to under 20 minutes. It's another project that I'm really proud of.
