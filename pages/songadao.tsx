            block it, it will never exist through any other medium; and be lost. The world will not
            have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, not how it compares with
            other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the
            channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep
            open and aware directly to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. No artist

          Since 2015, artists of all kinds have been experimenting with various ways of expressing
          digital scarcity. We have things like 1 of 1s, open editions, 10,000 PFP projects, and
          limited runs of generative art.

          The common element is that digital scarcity is something that we impose on our work; it's

          Song A Day NFT achieves digital scarcity through time. I will only ever write one song a
          day. I wrote 2000 songs before Ethereum was invented. I wrote another 1500 before I
          learned about digital scarcity. All of these songs will soon be NFTs, and starting in late
          fall/early winter of 2022, as I enter my 14th year of Song A Day, I will be releasing each
          new song as an NFT, every single day.
